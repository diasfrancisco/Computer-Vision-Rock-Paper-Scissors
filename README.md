# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Milestone 1

The model used for the Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors project was created using Teachable-Machine. The model was provided with image data from 4 classes. The classes were Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The image data was gathered using a webcam, with Teachable-Machine extracting the data frame by frame. After the data gathering phase the model was trained on a subset of the data and ready for download.

## Milestone 2

Prior to download the model was converted to a keras .h5 model in the cloud. After this conversion the model and labels file were downloaded and pushed to GitHub under the Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors repository (public)

## Milestone 3

To achieve milestone 3, I had to edit the README file (the current file you are viewing) to document the use of this model in the current project. The current model will be run in a new virtual environment on my local machine, with multiple iterations looking to add features such as user & computer inputs, win screens, a countdown timer, repetition until one party achieves 3 wins, game simulation and further optional features.
